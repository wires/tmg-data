The MASTER module is the base of every AE modular system; it contains

- the voltage regulation (5V) for the power supply of the modules

- a MIDI input (minijack; Breakout cable to DIN-5 socket is [available separately](https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p28/MIDI_Breakout_Cable.html))

- In/out-sockets (3.5mm minijack) for audio out and/or interfacing with a Eurorack system

- all bus signals (CV, GATE, CTRL, MIDI clock/start/stop) as patch sockets

The power supply is a 9V DC adapter ([see here](https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p23/Power_Supply_Adapter_9V_1.3A.html)); it can be connected either at the side or on the top of the module.
