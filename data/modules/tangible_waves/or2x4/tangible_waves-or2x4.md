The OR2x4 module combines 2x4 inputs by logical OR rule; the input signal are usually trigger/gate signals and are treateds as digital signals.

This can be used

- either for "mixing" gate/trigger signals from different sources
- or for audio signals. too.

There are two independend units with four inputs each; with a switch all eight inputs can be linked to a 8-input OR.

With the GATE inputs the signal can be controlled further; if GATE gets a "low" signal then the output is low also. By this, the output can be synced to a common clock signal and even if one of the inputs remains high the output changes. If the GATE input remains open, the module operates as a regular OR gate.
